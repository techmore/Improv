//Guessing Games
phrases[0]="<b>Interrogation</b><p>Two performers are police officers interrogating a third, who plays a suspect in a given crime. The suspect, however, does not know what the crime is and must deduce it from the clues given by the other performers.";

phrases[1]="Lets Make a Date - One performer (usually the fourth performer in the American version) is the contestant on a dating-type show. The other three performers are the possible dates who are given odd personalities or characters via envelopes. Following one or two rounds of questioning, contestant must guess who the others are."
phrases[2]="Newsflash - One performer, usually Colin Mochrie, stands in front of a green screen as a field reporter, while two others are news anchors. Certain footage is shown on the greenscreen which the anchors and the audience can see, while the reporter can see only the greenscreen. Based on clues in the anchors questioning - and sometimes the audiences reaction - the reporter must guess what kind of footage is being shown."
phrases[3]="Party Quirks - One performer hosts a party which the other three arrive at. The three guests are assigned odd personalities or characters via envelopes. Whenever he is able, the host must identify what each guest is portraying. The guests enter one-at-a-time at the prompting of a doorbell sounded by the host. When their quirk is guessed correctly, a performer returns to their seat."
phrases[4]="Press Conference - One performer is giving a press conference while the other three ask questions as reporters. The subject of the conference is either a known figure giving some sort of announcement (e.g. Santa retiring) or some sort of unusual achievement (e.g. the first female Pope). The subject is not informed of their identity, and must deduce it from the questions that the reporters ask."
// Dialogue-based games?
phrases[5]="Alphabet: Two performers enact a given scene in which each sentence must begin with the subsequent letter of the alphabet, beginning with an audience-suggested letter. The performers must go through the entire alphabet once."
phrases[6]="90-Second Alphabet: The American variant used two or three performers, and had a 90-second time-limit."
phrases[7]="Backwards Movie Overdubbing: Any number of performers make up the dialogue of movie without sound being played backwards."
phrases[8]="Backwards Scene: Two or three performers act out a given scene starting with the ending line and working their way line by line back to the beginning. Played only twice in the US version."
phrases[9]="Change Letter: Two or three performers act out a given scene, and must substitute every occurrence of a given letter in their dialogue with another given letter (e.g. every B must be changed to F). In the US version, all four performers would play."
phrases[10]="Every Other Line: One performer acts freely while another is given a book or play. That performer responds to the first by reading every other line of the work. The performer who is not reading must end the scene with an audience-suggested line. Played only in series 1, and once in series 4. Common on the radio edition."
phrases[11]="Expert Translation One performer is an expert on a given topic, but can only speak a given foreign language. Another performer translates into English. Played up to series 4."
phrases[12]="Foreign Film Dub: Two performers enact a scene in a foreign language (usually using accented gibberish) chosen by the audience, while the other two performers translate into English after each line. This often results in the translators putting the acting performers in compromising situations by translating their gibberish in embarrassing ways."
phrases[13]="Forward Reverse: Two performers start a scene, and two more later enter. Periodically the host will instruct the performers to go reverse, in which case they must reenact the performed scene backwards, and forward, in which case all reversed actions must be repeated in the proper order as originally. Only for the 2013 revival."
phrases[14]="If You Know What I Mean: Three performers improvise a scene in which they make up as many innuendos related to the given topic as they can, ending each with the phrase if you know what I mean."
phrases[15]="Number of Words: The four performers act out a given scene. Each is also assigned a number, which is the exact number of words each must use at a time."
phrases[16]="Questions Only: Two performers enact a given scene speaking only in questions, while the other performers wait off-stage, one behind each of them. If either performer speaks in a non-question, or takes too long to respond, the host sounds the buzzer and they are replaced by the performer behind them. In early UK playings, the game was not a competition and involved only two performers."
phrases[17]="Questions With Wigs: In this variation, the performers must act out the scene as a character dictated by the wig they are wearing. Played only twice."
phrases[18]="Questionable Impressions: In this variation, the performers must also do a different impression of their choice each time they enter the game."
phrases[19]="Questionable Impressions From TV: A sub-variation in which all impressions must be of TV personalities."
phrases[20]="Quick Change: Two or three performers enact a given scene. Another performer stands offstage and says change at various times during the scene; the performer who had the last line must then provide an alternate line. The changed line is commonly itself changed, leading to both confusion, or a punchline under the comedic rule of three."
phrases[21]="Song Titles: In the UK version, three or four performers act out a given scene speaking only in existing song titles. In the US version, two performers do the same, while the others wait off-stage, one behind each of them. If either performer speaks in a non-song-title, speaks a song lyric, or takes too long to respond, the host sounds the buzzer and they are replaced by the performer behind them. Similar to Questions Only."
phrases[22]="Two Line Vocabulary: Three performers enact a given scene. Two of the performers are limited to using only two specific given lines each."
